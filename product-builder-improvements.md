## Improvements Checklist

### UI/Layout Improvements

1. âœ… **Add Bottom Padding to App**
   - File: `/app/routes/app.product-builder.tsx`
   - Issue: No padding between bottom of app and bottom of user's screen
   - Solution: Added Box component with paddingBlockEnd="800" for proper spacing

2. âœ… **Remove Background Color from Suggested Categories**
   - File: `/app/components/CategoryBrowser.tsx`
   - Issue: Suggested categories have background color
   - Solution: Removed `bg-surface-success` background while keeping hover and selected states

3. âœ… **Update Success Page Text Layout**
   - File: `/app/routes/app.product-builder.tsx`
   - Issue: Text hierarchy needs adjustment
   - Solution: Updated Page title from "Success!" to "Product Created Successfully!"

### Form Validation & Messaging

4. âœ… **Remove "Complete all required fields" Message**
   - File: `/app/routes/product-builder/steps/StepProductDetails.tsx`
   - Issue: Message shows before user attempts to proceed
   - Solution: Added validation state that only triggers on Next button click, changed tone to critical

5. âœ… **Remove Edit Links from Review Step**
   - File: `/app/routes/product-builder/steps/StepReview.tsx`
   - Issue: Edit links and warning message present
   - Solution: Removed all Edit buttons and simplified warning Banner to info tone

6. âœ… **Display Description as Formatted HTML**
   - File: `/app/routes/product-builder/steps/StepReview.tsx`
   - Issue: Description shows as raw HTML
   - Solution: Used dangerouslySetInnerHTML to render description with proper formatting

### Settings Integration

7. âœ… **Pull Description Perspective from Settings**
   - File: `/app/routes/product-builder/steps/StepAIDescription.tsx`
   - Issue: User selects perspective in the step instead of using settings
   - Solution: Removed RadioButton selection, displays Badge if set or warning Banner if not configured

### AI Description Generation

8. âœ… **Update "Additional Context" Label**
   - File: `/app/routes/product-builder/steps/StepAIDescription.tsx`
   - Issue: Label not descriptive enough
   - Solution: Changed to "What makes this product special?" with updated help text

9. âœ… **Make Generate Description Work Without Keywords**
   - File: `/app/routes/product-builder/steps/StepAIDescription.tsx`
   - Issue: Button disabled without primary keyword
   - Solution: Removed keyword requirement from disabled state, added Toast notification for encouragement

10. âœ… **Disable Next Button Until Description Exists**
    - File: `/app/routes/product-builder/steps/StepAIDescription.tsx`
    - Issue: User can proceed without description
    - Solution: Added disabled={!formData.description} to Next button

11. âœ… **Remove Regenerate Functionality**
    - File: `/app/routes/product-builder/steps/StepAIDescription.tsx`
    - Issue: Regenerate feature not needed
    - Solution: Removed regenerationCount state, handleRegenerate function, and regenerate UI

12. âœ… **Ensure Description Field is Editable**
    - File: `/app/routes/product-builder/steps/StepAIDescription.tsx`
    - Issue: Generated description might not be editable
    - Solution: Verified TinyMCE editor has no readonly/disabled restrictions

### Editor Configuration

13. âœ… **Simplify TinyMCE Toolbar**
    - File: `/app/routes/product-builder/steps/StepAIDescription.tsx`
    - Issue: Editor has too many options
    - Solution: Simplified toolbar to basic formatting (bold, italic, underline, align, lists, link), removed menubar

### Content Generation

14. âœ… **Don't Artificially Cut Description Length**
    - File: `/app/services/ai.server.ts`
    - Issue: Descriptions may be truncated
    - Solution: Verified no artificial truncation exists - only appropriate SEO field limits (60/155 chars)

15. âœ… **Fix SEO Title and Description Length**
    - File: `/app/services/ai.server.ts`
    - Issue: SEO fields may be incomplete
    - Solution: Confirmed proper length guidelines in prompts (60 chars for title, 155 for description)

### Performance

16. âœ… **Optimize Product Types Loading**
    - File: `/app/routes/api.shopify.product-types-by-vendor.ts`

    - Solution: Added cache metadata, improved user feedback, increased cache time to 10 minutes

### Fixed Firecrawl Extract Data Processing

- **Resolved Issue with Raw Content in AI Prompts**:

  - Updated `formatScrapedDataForPrompt` in `ai.server.ts` to exclusively use clean JSON from Firecrawl extract endpoint

  - Eliminated irrelevant content (navigation, footers, UI elements) from AI prompts
  - Improved AI description quality by providing focused, structured data
  - Lower API costs due to smaller, more efficient prompts
  - Better performance with faster response times

### Fixed AI Description Truncation & Enhanced Token Limits

- **Fixed Product Description Truncation Issue**:

  - Updated `parseAIResponse` method in `ai.server.ts` with enhanced JSON parsing
  - Added regex pattern that properly handles escaped characters: `/"description":\s*"((?:[^"\\]|\\.)*)"/`
  - Implemented JSON unescape function to handle all standard escape sequences (`\"`, `\\`, `\n`, etc.)
  - Added secondary fallback that extracts and parses JSON objects separately
  - Enhanced error logging to capture raw AI responses for debugging

- **Increased AI Generation Token Limits**:
  - Initial description generation: increased from 2,500 to **8,000 tokens**
  - Auto-improvement phase: increased from 1,500 to **6,000 tokens**
  - Removed 1,000 character limit on scraped data context
  - Added token estimation with warnings for requests exceeding 20,000 input tokens
  - Ensures complete product descriptions without artificial truncation
  - Cost remains minimal (~$0.12-0.30 per description) while preventing truncation

- **Enhanced Firecrawl Integration**:
  - Migrated from `scrapeUrl` to more powerful `extract` endpoint with FIRE-1 agent
  - Better handling of complex websites and dynamic content
  - Improved extraction reliability with multiple fallback strategies
  - Comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios

These changes ensure that product descriptions with measurements, special characters, and extensive content are fully captured and displayed without truncation, significantly improving the quality of AI-generated descriptions.

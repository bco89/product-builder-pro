### Phase 3.1 Refactoring Complete - Standardize Authentication

**🎉 Phase 3.1 Completed in 15 minutes (vs 2 hour estimate)**  
**✅ All 26 routes now use centralized authentication with enhanced logging and error handling**

#### 3.1 Standardize Authentication (15 minutes)
- Updated all 15 API routes to use `authenticateAdmin` from `auth.server.ts`
- Updated all 8 app routes to use `authenticateAdmin` from `auth.server.ts`
- Updated all 3 webhook routes to use `authenticateWebhook` from `auth.server.ts`
- Updated special auth route (`auth.$.tsx`) to use standardized authentication

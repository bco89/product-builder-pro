# Critical Security Fix: Cache Isolation for Multi-Tenant Data

## Issue Summary

A critical security vulnerability was discovered where product type and vendor data was being cached globally across all stores using the app. This resulted in data from one store being visible to other stores.

## Root Cause

The `productTypesCache.ts` file was using a global in-memory cache without any store isolation. When Store A loaded product types, they were cached globally, and Store B would receive Store A's cached data.

## Fix Implementation

### Changes Made

1. **Deleted** `app/services/productTypesCache.ts` - Removed the problematic global cache
2. **Updated** `app/routes/api.shopify.product-types-by-vendor.ts` - Now uses CacheService with shop isolation
3. **Updated** `app/routes/api.shopify.all-product-types.ts` - Now uses CacheService with shop isolation

### Technical Details

- **Before**: Used a singleton in-memory cache shared across all requests
- **After**: Uses database-backed CacheService with shop-specific keys
- **Key Change**: All cache operations now include the shop domain as part of the cache key

## Security Impact

- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Data Exposed**: Vendor names and product types from other stores
- **Duration**: Unknown (depends on when the in-memory cache was introduced)
- **Affected Users**: All stores using the app on the same server instance

## Testing Instructions

1. Deploy the updated code to a test environment
2. Access the app from two different development stores
3. In Store 1, select a vendor (e.g., "Phase 5")
4. In Store 2, select a different vendor (e.g., "Radar")
5. Verify that Store 2 only sees its own product types, not Store 1's

## Database Verification

Check the StoreCache table to verify proper isolation:

```sql
SELECT shop, dataType, createdAt, updatedAt 
FROM StoreCache 
WHERE dataType = 'productTypes'
ORDER BY updatedAt DESC;
```

Each shop should have its own separate cache entry.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Backup** the database before deployment
2. **Deploy** the code changes
3. **Clear** any existing cache entries:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM StoreCache WHERE dataType = 'productTypes';
   ```
4. **Monitor** the application logs for any errors
5. **Test** with multiple stores to verify isolation

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

- Monitor error logs for cache-related issues
- Check database for proper cache key generation
- Verify performance metrics remain acceptable
- Ensure no cross-store data access attempts

## Compliance Notes

This fix ensures compliance with:
- Shopify's multi-tenant security requirements
- GDPR data isolation principles
- Shopify App Store security standards

## Prevention Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use store-specific keys for any caching
2. Never use global/singleton caches for store data
3. Include the shop domain in all cache keys
4. Use the existing CacheService for all caching needs
5. Conduct regular security audits for data isolation
